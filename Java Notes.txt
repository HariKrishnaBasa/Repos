Java: 

1. Identifier: 

 a name in java program is called identifier. which can used for identification purpose. It can be method name or variable name or class name or lable name
 example: 
 class test--1
 { 
   public static void main--2 ( string--3[]args--4) 
   { 
      int x--5=10;
	}
  }
      
Rules for defining java identifiers:
1. atoz AtoZ 0-9 $ _--allowed characters , if we are using any other characters , will get compile time error

ex: total_number --allowed,  total# --not allowed
2. Identifiers can't start with digit.
ex: total123 - allowed , 123total--not allowed

3. Java identifiers are case sensitive, of course java language itself treated as case sensitive programming language. 

  class test 
  {  
      int number=10;
	  int Number=10;  --we can differntiate with case. 
	  int NUMBER=10;
	  
	 }

4. There is no length limit for  java identifier. But it's not recommended to take too lengthy identifiers. 
5. we can't use reserved words as identifiers. 
ex: int x=10;--valid
    int if =20; -- invalid.
6. All predefined java class names and interface names we can use as identifiers. Eventhougg if it's valid But it's not recommended , it reduces readablity and creates confusion. 	
   ex: class test                              
      { 
	    public static void  main(string[] args)
		 {
		   int String = 10;
		   s.o.println(String);
		   }
		   }
		   class test 
      { 
	    public static void  main(string[] args)
		 {
		   int Runnable = 10;
		   s.o.println(Runnable);
		   }
		   }
ex: 
total_number--valid
Integer  --valid
Int --valid
int --not valid , why bcoz it's a reserved word 

Reserverd words: 

1. 53 reserved words are there.

  Keywords = 50 - 
    used key words = 48 -  if , else, else if ..etc
	unused key word =2 - goto,const
  Literals = 3 -  true, false, null
  
  Diff: If reserved words represents functionality i.e keyword and If reserved words represents value i.e Literal
  
 Data types: =8
 byte, short,int,long,double,float,boolean, char 
 
 Key words for flow control: =11
 if, else , switch, case, default,do, while, for, break, continue , return 
 
 Key words for modifiers: =11
 public, private, protected,static,final,abstract, synchronized, naive, strictfp(1.2v), transient, volatile
 
 Keywords exception handling: =6
 try , catch ,  finally, throw, throws , assert(1.4v)	
 
 Class related Key words: =6
 class, interface, extends, implements, package, import
 
 Object related key words:=4
 new, instanceof, super,this
 
 Void retrun type key word : 
 In Java return type is mandatory , if method won't return anything then we have to declare method with void return type. 
 But in c language return type is optional and default return type is int. 
 
 Unused Keywords: 
 1. goto = usage of goto create several in old lanaguages. and hence sun people banned this keyword in Java. 
 2. const=  use final instead of const. 
 Note: goto and const are unused keywords and if we are trying to use we will get compile time error. 
 
 Reserved Literals: 
 true, false = values for boolean data type.
 null= default value for object reference. 
 
 ENUM Key word:
 enum(1.5v) - we can use enum to define a group of named constants. 
 ex: 
 enum month
 {
	 JAN,FEB...DEC
 }
 enum BEER
 {
	 KF, KO,RC,FO 	
 }
 
Conclusion: 
 1. all 53 reserved words in java , contains only lower case alphabets symobols. 
 2. In java we have only new key word and there is no delete key word in Java, bcoz distraction of useless object is the responsbility of garbage collector. 
 3. The following are new keywords in Java. 
    strictfp, assert, enum 
 
 
Question: 
which of the following list contains only java reserved words.

goto,delete,
new,constant,
break, continue, return,exit,
final,finally,finalize,
throw, throws,thrown, 
notify,notifyAll,
implements,extends,imports,
sizeof, instanceof,	
byte, short,Int
none of the above  -- correct answer. 
2. which of the following are java reserved words. 

public
static
void
main 
string
args
